- 👋 Hi, I’m Nolan Appel. I am a chemist by education and currently (Feb 2022) by profession as well. I hope to make a transition into the data analytics/science field. The more I learn about programming the more I realize That I like looking at data, figuring out puzzles, trying to explain the abstract, and that I want a better salary and life than a chemistry profession will for a bachelors degree holder. 

- 👀 I’m interested in many things, but the top of the list includes horticulture, especially bonsai trees, history, philosophy, combat sports, law, video games, travelling (though I don't do much of it I love to when i can), and learning more about computer and software engineering.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning (trying to learn) python, R, and SQL because those seem to be the best place to start.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on.... There are many ideas for programs and applications that I have. Please ask if you want to discuss.

- 📫 How to reach me ... Email:Noappel94@outlook.com
